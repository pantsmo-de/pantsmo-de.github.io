		<q><i>In the end, it's about skilful expression, not the exploration of the ego. 
		Don't aim for the absolute best because you'll crave for it, you'll cling to it, attach to it, create suffering from it. 
		Some artists fall too deep into the way of the ego, now they suffer from jealousy, anger, the need for conflict and gossip, all sorts... If you aspire for wealth, to be loved by whom you love, to influence others in a negative light, to be revered by others at your feet, <b>then stop there.</b><br><br>Aspire for wisdom, the greater good, the unfolding of your own nature...<br><br><b>the expression.</b></i></q>
